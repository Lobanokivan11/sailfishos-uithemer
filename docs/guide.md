# Usage guide

UI Themer lets you customize icons, fonts and pixel density in Sailfish OS.

Remember to unapply themes and display density customizations before updating your system. In case you forgot, you may need to use the options provided in the *Recovery* page or uninstall and reinstall Theme pack support and UI Themer.

UI Themer is divided into three main sections, which provide you icons, fonts and display density customization, alongside additional options.

## Themes

The *Themes* page lets you customize icons and fonts via thirdy party themes. The page lists the themes you have currently installed (e.g. from OpenRepos). To apply them, tap on a theme of your choice and then select what you want to use from that theme - if the theme contains different font weights, you can choose the default one to use for the UI. You can also combine different themes, so for example you can use icons from a theme and fonts from another. To revert to the default settings, you can use the restore option from the pulley menu.

An homescreen restart may be needed to apply your settings. You can do that through the dialog or from the *Options* page.

If you have Storeman installed, you can quickly look for compatible themes by using the *Download* icon in the main page.

## Display density

By increasing the display density, you can display more content on your screen - or less, if you prefer to have bigger UI elements. Android apps use a different setting than Sailfish OS ones. To revert to the default settings, you can use the restore options from the pulley menu.

An homescreen restart may be needed to apply your settings. You can do that through the dialog or from the *Options* page.

## Icon updater

Everytime an app is updated, you need to re-apply the theme in order to get the custom icon back. *Icon updater* will automate this process, enabling automatic update of icons at a given time. You can choose between a pre-defined set of hours or a custom hour of the day.

## One-click restore

UI Themer customizations must be reverted before performing a system update. With One-click restore you can automate this process and restore icons, fonts and display density settings with just one click.

## Keyboard shortcuts

UI Themer can be navigated via a physical keyboard, using convenient shortcuts.

Press **H** for the home page.
Press **D** for the display density page.
Press **O** for the options page.
Press **G** for the usage guide.
Press **A** for the about page.
Press **W** for restart the first run wizard.
Press **B** to go back to the previous page.
You can quickly restart the homescreen after you applied a setting by pressing **R**.
You can cancel a countdown or a dialog by pressing **C**.

## Recovery

Here you can find advanced settings for UI Themer, e.g. reinstall default icons or fonts if you forget to revert to default theme before a system update or if the applying fails.

## Backup & restore

If you are working on a theme or you want to have the default icons in a safe place, you can backup them. A compressed archive will be created and saved into */home/nemo/*. You can also restore a previous backup.
